If this is the case, a full or partial decelerometer test may be appropriate. You should consider any additional information from the vehicle manufacturer.\n\nWhen conducting a test on a roller brake tester (RBT) where more than half of the wheels of a brake system lock the efficiency requirements for that system are considered to be met.\n\nAlternatively, the efficiency requirements are met if the front wheels lock on the service brake of an unladen Class 7 vehicle with at least a 100kg force at each rear wheel for a two-axle vehicle, or at least 50kg force at each rear wheel on a three-axle vehicle.\n\nWhen testing using an Automated RBT or a plate brake tester, the vehicle test weight for Classes 3 and 4 is the weight shown by the brake test equipment.\n\nFor non-automated roller brake testers the brake test weight must be obtained from a brake data chart or other reliable source.\n\nFor Class 7 use the DGW from the manufacture's plate or, the nominal DGW of 2,600kg if using a plate brake tester and the presented weight is less than 2,000kg.\n\nFor Class 5 use the lesser of the DGW or maximum authorised mass (MAM) from the manufacturer's plate. On vehicles where only the ULW is displayed, you must calculate the DGW by multiplying the number of passenger seats by 63.5kg and adding the ULW, for example: 52 seats × 63.5kg = 3302kg + 5,250kg ULW = 8552kg.\n\nVehicles of unknown test weight can be tested on either an RBT or plate brake tester (PBT). However, if the number of wheel locks are not achieved for any system on a non-ATL RBT, a decelerometer test must be used to establish the overall brake efficiency of the relevant system(s).\n\nCertain converted passenger vehicles, such as motor caravans and ambulances, may have a kerb weight greatly in excess of the base model weight displayed by the MOT testing service. In these circumstances, the vehicle should be treated as having an unknown test weight.\n\nAdditional braking devices, such as electronic retarders, should not be operated during the brake test.\n\nSome tricycles with two brake controls may have a linked braking system. The brake force used in the efficiency calculation is the total from all wheels when operated by that control only.",

Stopping short of lock up or maximum effort, hold a steady pedal pressure and check there is no excessive brake effort fluctuation with each revolution of the road wheel.\n\n3. Gradually release the service brake and observe how the braking effort at each wheel reduces.\n\n4. Gradually depress the service brake again, this time until maximum effort is achieved, or until the wheel locks and slips on the rollers. Stop the rollers.\n\n5. Record the reading at which the maximum braking effort is achieved and whether brake \"lock-up\" occurs. Stop the rollers if they have not stopped automatically.\n\n6.

              "description": "For vehicles other than Class 7, establish the actual presented weight of the vehicle.\n\nFor Class 7 vehicles, the brake efficiency will be calculated using one of the following:\n- the actual design gross weight (DGW) where the presented weight is at least 2,000kg (the DGW is obtained from the manufacturer's plate fitted to the vehicle)\n- a nominal DGW figure of 2,600kg if the presented weight is less than 2,000kg\n\nTo use a plate brake tester:\n\n1. Enter the appropriate data to conduct the test.\n\n2. For each check, drive the vehicle forwards at a steady speed of about 4mph up to the plate tester.\n\n3. On the first run, just before the wheels are on the plate high friction surfaces, apply a light constant pressure to the brake pedal. Do not stop on the tester. Take note of the way the brake efforts fluctuate.\n\n4. On the second run, as soon as the wheels are on the plate high friction braking surfaces, apply the service brake progressively until maximum effort is achieved.\n\n5. Take note of the way the brake efforts increase and the maximum values achieved.\n\nIf a vehicle fails any aspect of the plate brake test, the check should be repeated to confirm the result."
