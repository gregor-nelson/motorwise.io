## Architecture

MotCheck-UK employs a microservices pattern. The frontend is a **React (v19)** application built with **Vite**, communicating with several independent **Python/FastAPI** backend services.

### Frontend (`/frontend/`)

* **Framework/Build:** React 19 with Vite
* **UI Library:** Material-UI (`@mui/material`)
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **Payment:** Stripe Integration
* **Charting:** Recharts
* **PDF Generation:** pdfmake

**Key Frontend Directories:**

* `/frontend/src/components/AutoData/`: Components for vehicle data and analysis.
* `/frontend/src/components/Results/`: Components for MOT history and search results.
* `/frontend/src/pages/`: Main application pages.
* `/frontend/src/middleware/`: Custom middleware for data processing.
* `/frontend/src/styles/`: Material-UI theming system.

### Backend Services (`/backend/`)

Each backend service is a specialized FastAPI application.

1.  **DVLA API** (`/backend/dvla_api/`)
    * **Port:** `8004`
    * **Function:** Integrates with DVLA Vehicle Enquiry Service for vehicle registration data.
2.  **MOT API** (`/backend/mot_api/`)
    * **Port:** Varies (check service configuration)
    * **Function:** Fetches MOT history and advisory information from government APIs.
3.  **Auto Data API** (`/backend/auto_data_api/`)
    * **Port:** `8005`
    * **Function:** Provides repair times, technical specifications, and maintenance data. Static data located in `/backend/auto_data_api/data/`.
4.  **Claude API** (`/backend/claude_api/`)
    * **Function:** AI-powered vehicle analysis, risk assessment, and insights generation.
5.  **Manual API** (`/backend/manual_api/`)
    * **Function:** Provides access to MOT manual data, test procedures, and requirements.
6.  **Stripe API** (`/backend/stripe_api/`)
    * **Function:** Handles payment processing for premium features.
7.  **TSB API** (`/backend/tsb_api/`)
    * **Function:** Delivers Technical Service Bulletins, including manufacturer recalls and fix information.

### Data Processing & Integration

* **Vehicle Analysis Pipeline:**
    1.  Registration lookup (DVLA API).
    2.  MOT history retrieval and analysis (MOT API).
    3.  Cross-reference with technical specifications (Auto Data API).
    4.  AI-powered risk assessment (Claude API).
    5.  Integration with TSB/recall data (TSB API).
* **Key Data Sources:**
    * `/backend/auto_data_api/data/`: Static vehicle data (repair times, tech specs).
    * `/utils/fix_details*/`: Detailed fix information for specific vehicles.
* **Data Storage:** Primarily JSON-based for static information.
* **Caching:** TTL caches implemented for expensive API calls to improve performance and reduce external service load.

### Service Communication

* **CORS:** Configured for cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend APIs.
* **Middleware:** Includes compression, structured logging, and error handling. Pydantic models are used for request/response validation in backend services.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implemented within individual backend services.

### Environment Configuration

Services rely on environment variables for configuration (API keys, service ports, external API endpoints, feature flags).

* Create a `.env` file in the root directory or in individual service directories as needed.
* Populate it with necessary values based on an `.env.example` file (if provided) or the following common variables:
    * `DVLA_API_KEY`
    * `MOT_CLIENT_ID`
    * `MOT_CLIENT_SECRET`
    * `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
    * `CLAUDE_API_KEY`
    * Service-specific `HOST` and `PORT` variables.
    * `USE_TEST_ENV` (feature flag)
