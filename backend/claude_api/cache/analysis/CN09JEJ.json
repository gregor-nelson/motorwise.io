pressure sensors before replacing hydraulic modulator\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Engine Oil System\nCATEGORY: ENGINE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 3\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Recent oil leak advisories and DPF-related oil level issues\nFINDINGS:\n- Oil leak, but not excessive (Two separate advisories in latest 2024 MOT)\n- Technical bulletin for engine oil level too high due to DPF regeneration issues\n- Technical bulletin indicates ECM software fault causes incomplete DPF regeneration\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Vehicle Structure\nCATEGORY: STRUCTURE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 3\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Progressive corrosion on underside and subframe\nFINDINGS:\n- Underside corrosion (Advisory in 2024 MOT)\n- Vehicle structure is corroded but structural rigidity not significantly reduced (Advisory in 2024)\n- Rear Sub-frame corroded but not seriously weakened (Advisory in 2018)\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Exhaust System\nCATEGORY: EXHAUST\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 2\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Corrosion at joints and vibration issues\nFINDINGS:\n- Exhaust joints corroded (Advisory in 2016)\n- Technical bulletin for vibration through vehicle during idling due to incorrectly positioned rear silencer hanger bracket\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Tyre Condition\nCATEGORY: TYRES\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 2\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: History of tyre wear issues including one dangerous defect\nFINDINGS:\n- Nearside Front Tyre tread depth below requirements of 1.6mm (Dangerous defect in 2021)\n- Both Rear Tyres worn close to legal limit at 2mm depth (Advisory in 2016)\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Diesel Emission System\nCATEGORY: ENGINE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 3\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: DPF and emission control system issues\nFINDINGS:\n- Emissions not tested (Major defect in 2021 MOT)\n- Technical bulletin for DPF warning lamp illuminated due to ECM software fault\n- Technical bulletin for Engine MIL illuminated with code P0087, engine runs in limp mode\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Electrical System\nCATEGORY: ELECTRICAL\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 1\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Battery discharge and AC compressor issues\nFINDINGS:\n- Technical bulletin indicates battery discharge and irregular AC compressor clutch operation due to faulty relay\nSYSTEM_END\n\n## SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_END\n\n## PATTERN_ANALYSIS_START\nRECURRING_ISSUES:\n- Suspension component wear appears consistently across MOT history, affecting both front and rear components\n- Brake system wear has been noted in multiple MOTs, with disc and pad issues recurring\n- Corrosion issues have progressed from exhaust joints to subframe and now to the vehicle structure\n\nPROGRESSIVE_DETERIORATION:\n- Vehicle structure corrosion has worsened over time, progressing from subframe corrosion in 2018 to broader underside and structural corrosion in 2024\n\nBULLETIN_CORRELATIONS:\n- The suspension wear issues correlate with technical bulletins about rear differential oil causing shudder when cornering\n- Oil leaks noted in recent MOT correlate with technical bulletins regarding DPF regeneration issues causing elevated oil levels\n- Braking system advisories correlate with technical bulletins about ABS pressure sensor issues\n## PATTERN_ANALYSIS_END\n\n## RISK_FACTORS_START\n- High mileage vehicle (127,930 miles) with increasing rate of advisories in recent MOTs\n- Structural corrosion is worsening and could lead to MOT failure in the future\n- Ongoing oil leaks could indicate engine sealing issues that may worsen\n- Suspension component wear is a recurring pattern that suggests ongoing maintenance needs\n- Recent multiple advisories in 2024 MOT suggest maintenance may be falling behind vehicle's age-related deterioration\n## RISK_FACTORS_END\n\n## POSITIVE_FACTORS_START\n- Vehicle has passed its most recent MOT despite multiple advisories\n- Major defects have been addressed promptly between failed and passed MOTs\n- Many technical bulletins provide specific remedies for known issues\n- No dangerous defects recorded in the most recent MOTs (since 2021)\n## POSITIVE_FACTORS_END\n\n## MAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_START\n- Suspension components require thorough inspection and likely replacement, particularly front suspension arm bushes\n- Vehicle's structural corrosion should be addressed before it progresses to a major defect\n- Engine oil leaks should be investigated and rectified to prevent potential engine damage\n- DPF system likely needs ECM software update as per technical bulletin\n- Brake system requires inspection for ongoing \"grabbing\" issue mentioned in recent MOTs\n- Rear differential oil should be checked and possibly replaced with correct specification as per technical bulletin\n## MAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_END\n\nSUMMARY: This 2009 Honda CR-V has covered 127,930 miles and shows evidence of age-related deterioration across multiple systems. The vehicle has a consistent MOT history but with increasing advisories in recent tests. Of particular concern are the structural corrosion issues which have progressed over time, ongoing suspension component wear affecting both front and rear assemblies, and recent oil leaks. The braking system has shown recurring issues including recent brake grabbing. Several of the MOT findings correlate with known technical bulletins, suggesting these are common issues for this model. While the vehicle remains roadworthy, the increasing number and severity of advisories indicate that more comprehensive maintenance will be required to maintain its condition. The technical bulletins provide clear remedies for many of the issues identified, which could help guide an effective maintenance programme. Overall, the vehicle presents a medium risk profile due to its age, mileage, and progressive deterioration patterns.",
