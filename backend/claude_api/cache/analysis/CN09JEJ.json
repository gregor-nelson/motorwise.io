The vehicle has developed progressive structural corrosion that, while not currently affecting rigidity according to MOT records, is increasingly noted in test results. Suspension components show a clear pattern of wear with multiple anti-roll bar linkages and bushes requiring attention throughout the vehicle's history. The front suspension components have been particular failure points.\n\nOil leaks have been recently documented but are currently rated as \"not excessive.\" The braking system has shown intermittent issues including grabbing and component wear over multiple tests. Technical service bulletins for this model indicate known issues with brake system fluid pressure, exhaust mounting problems, and potential rear differential issues that could present similar symptoms to some of the documented problems.\n\nThe recurring nature of suspension component wear suggests an underlying pattern beyond normal aging that may be specific to this model or related to driving conditions. The vehicle structure requires monitoring due to the progression of corrosion noted in recent tests.",
