The most significant issues involve progressive structural corrosion, suspension component wear, and engine oil leaks. The vehicle's MOT history shows a pattern of addressing issues promptly, but recent advisories for corrosion and oil leaks suggest ongoing attention is required. Technical bulletins highlight known issues with this model including DPF regeneration problems, braking efficiency concerns, and drivetrain shudder. The vehicle presents a medium overall risk, with its primary strengths being regular maintenance and successful MOT passes, while its weaknesses center on developing corrosion and wear to critical mechanical components that will require ongoing investment to maintain roadworthiness.",
