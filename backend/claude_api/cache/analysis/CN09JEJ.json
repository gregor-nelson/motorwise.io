The MOT history reveals recurring issues with suspension bushes and linkages, brake system wear, and progressive corrosion of the vehicle structure. Technical bulletins highlight several known issues for this model, including DPF problems that can affect engine oil levels, braking efficiency concerns, and engine management faults. The vehicle has failed MOT tests on three occasions (2016, 2021, and 2023) for significant defects including a shock absorber leak, dangerous tyre wear, and worn suspension components. While the vehicle passed its most recent MOT in October 2024, there are multiple advisory items that require monitoring, particularly the oil leaks and structural corrosion. The pattern of issues suggests maintenance has been reactive rather than preventative, which may lead to more significant problems if not addressed proactively.",
