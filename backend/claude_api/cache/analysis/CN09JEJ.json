BRAKING\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 4\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Recurring brake component issues including grabbing brakes and worn components\nFINDINGS:\n- Service brake grabbing slightly noted in 2023 MOTs (both failed and passed tests)\n- Rear brake pads wearing thin advisory in 2019\n- Multiple brake discs worn, pitted or scored at all four corners in 2012\n- Technical bulletin for loss of braking efficiency related to ABS pressure sensors (codes 43, 47)\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Vehicle Structure\nCATEGORY: STRUCTURE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 3\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Progressive corrosion issues affecting multiple structural areas\nFINDINGS:\n- Underside corrosion noted in most recent 2024 MOT\n- Vehicle structure corrosion affecting structural rigidity (2024 advisory)\n- Rear sub-frame corrosion noted as early as 2018\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Engine Oil System\nCATEGORY: ENGINE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 2\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Oil leaks present but not deemed excessive\nFINDINGS:\n- Two separate oil leak advisories noted in 2024 MOT, described as \"not excessive\"\n- Technical bulletin references issue with engine oil level becoming too high due to DPF regeneration issues\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Tyre Condition\nCATEGORY: TYRES\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 2\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Historical issues with tyre tread depth\nFINDINGS:\n- Nearside front tyre tread depth below legal requirement (dangerous defect) in 2021\n- Both rear tyres worn close to legal limit (2mm) in 2016\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Exhaust System\nCATEGORY: EXHAUST\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 2\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Exhaust system deterioration with corrosion and vibration issues\nFINDINGS:\n- Exhaust joints corrosion noted in 2016\n- Technical bulletin for vehicle vibration when idling related to exhaust silencer mounting\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Diesel Particulate Filter\nCATEGORY: ENGINE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 1\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Known issue with DPF regeneration process\nFINDINGS:\n- Technical bulletin indicates ECM software fault affecting DPF regeneration process\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Electrical System\nCATEGORY: ELECTRICAL\nSTATUS: GOOD\nISSUE_COUNT: 0\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: No electrical issues found in MOT history despite bulletins for potential problems\nFINDINGS:\n- Technical bulletin references potential battery discharge due to AC compressor clutch relay fault\n- No electrical failures or advisories in actual MOT history\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM_ANALYSIS_END\n\nPATTERN_ANALYSIS_START\nRECURRING_ISSUES:\n- Suspension component wear appears in multiple MOTs with different components affected (bushes, linkages, shock absorbers)\n- Braking system issues repeat with different manifestations (disc wear, pad wear, grabbing)\n- Progressive corrosion affecting multiple structural areas\n\nPROGRESSIVE_DETERIORATION:\n- Vehicle structure corrosion has progressed from sub-frame corrosion in 2018 to more general underside corrosion and reduced structural rigidity by 2024\n\nBULLETIN_CORRELATIONS:\n- Braking system bulletin for loss of braking efficiency correlates with MOT advisories about brake grabbing\n- Vehicle vibration bulletin for exhaust system correlates with MOT advisory about corroded exhaust joints\nPATTERN_ANALYSIS_END\n\nRISK_FACTORS_START\n- High mileage vehicle (127,930 miles as of last MOT) showing age-related deterioration\n- Structural corrosion is progressing and may become a safety concern\n- Multiple suspension component failures indicate potential for future issues\n- Oil leaks could worsen and lead to more significant engine problems\n- The vehicle has been failed on suspension issues requiring repair\nRISK_FACTORS_END\n\nPOSITIVE_FACTORS_START\n- Most recent MOT was passed despite advisories\n- Recent issues have been addressed promptly as evidenced by quick rectification after failures\n- No electrical system failures despite technical bulletins indicating potential problems\n- Vehicle has maintained consistent MOT history suggesting regular maintenance\nPOSITIVE_FACTORS_END\n\nMAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_START\n- Suspension components require regular inspection due to recurring issues\n- Brake system should be checked frequently as the vehicle has a history of brake component wear\n- Underbody corrosion treatment is strongly recommended to prevent further structural deterioration\n- Monitor oil level regularly due to both leaks and potential DPF-related oil level increases\n- Ensure DPF regeneration cycles complete by taking regular longer journeys\nMAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_END\n\nSUMMARY: This 2009 Honda CR-V has accumulated 127,930 miles and shows patterns of wear consistent with its age and mileage. The vehicle structure is experiencing progressive corrosion that requires attention to prevent serious deterioration. Suspension components have been a recurring issue, with failures noted in bushes, linkages and shock absorbers. The braking system has shown various problems including component wear and performance issues. Recent oil leaks suggest developing engine sealing problems, though currently classified as minor. While the vehicle continues to pass MOTs following repairs, the increasing frequency of advisories and the progression of corrosion indicate that maintenance costs are likely to increase. Technical bulletins highlight known issues with this model, particularly related to the DPF system, braking efficiency, and exhaust mounting. Overall, this CR-V requires vigilant maintenance with particular attention to structural integrity, suspension components and engine oil condition.",
