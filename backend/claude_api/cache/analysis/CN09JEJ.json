The suspension system appears to be the most vulnerable area of the vehicle.\n\n## Summary Notes\n\nThis Honda CR-V displays recurring issues with suspension components, particularly affecting anti-roll bar linkages, bushes, and ball joints. The pattern suggests progressive wear of front suspension components requiring regular maintenance.\n\nStructural corrosion is becoming more pronounced with age, with multiple advisories in the most recent MOT indicating this is an escalating concern, though not yet compromising structural integrity.\n\nOil leaks have recently been identified but are currently classified as non-excessive, warranting monitoring. The braking system has shown intermittent minor issues but no critical failures.\n\nThe vehicle's failure patterns and technical bulletins suggest this model is prone to suspension component wear and potential rear differential issues that can manifest as handling problems. Regular inspection of suspension components and monitoring of corrosion progression would be prudent.",
