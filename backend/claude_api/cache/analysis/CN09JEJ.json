The vehicle has passed recent MOTs despite developing advisories, indicating maintenance is being performed. The suspension system shows the most concerning pattern, with multiple components exhibiting wear across several years. The vehicle structure has shown increasing signs of corrosion, which, while not currently compromising structural integrity, will require monitoring. Technical bulletins highlight several known issues with this model, including DPF regeneration problems, exhaust system vibrations, and potential braking efficiency issues. Overall, this CR-V presents a medium risk profile typical of a higher-mileage diesel SUV, with most issues manageable through regular maintenance but with potential for more significant repairs particularly related to corrosion and diesel emission systems.",
