The most significant concerns are emissions failures, extensive corrosion affecting multiple systems, and recurring brake system advisories. The vehicle has a documented history of structural corrosion that required repair in 2018. Recent MOT tests indicate ongoing maintenance issues with emissions control systems and persistent corrosion of critical components including brake pipes and fuel lines. The suspension system shows signs of wear with multiple components flagged in recent tests.",
