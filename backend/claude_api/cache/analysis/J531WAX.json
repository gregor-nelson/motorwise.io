Emissions failure in 2025 indicates potential engine performance issues requiring attention\n- Corroded brake pipes on multiple wheels represents potential safety risk\n- Corroded fuel pipes could lead to fuel leaks and safety hazards\n- Previous structural corrosion of rear sills could compromise safety in accident\n- Loose wheel fixings (dangerous defect in 2018) indicates potential maintenance lapses\nRISK_FACTORS_END\n\nPOSITIVE_FACTORS_START\n- Vehicle has passed most recent MOT test after repairs\n- Regular testing and maintenance observed throughout vehicle history\n- Mileage increase relatively modest in recent years (approximately 13,000 miles over past 9 years)\nPOSITIVE_FACTORS_END\n\nMAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_START\n- Brake system requires thorough inspection with particular attention to corroded pipes\n- Emissions system needs diagnostic assessment and potential carburetor/fuel system service\n- Suspension components should be checked for further deterioration of bushes and dust covers\n- Vehicle is showing typical age-related corrosion that requires ongoing monitoring\n- Front wheel alignment should be checked given recurring headlamp aim issues\nMAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_END\n\nSUMMARY: This Mazda Eunos presents a moderate risk profile with several concerning issues across multiple vehicle systems. With 157,760 miles recorded, the vehicle shows expected wear for its age but has several recurring problems that require attention. Most concerning are the recent emissions failures, widespread brake pipe corrosion, and historical structural issues. The brake system shows progressive deterioration with pipes now corroded at multiple points. The suspension system has recurring issues with bushes and dust covers, while the lighting system consistently presents headlamp alignment problems. The recent MOT pass suggests these issues have been addressed, but the pattern of failures indicates the need for comprehensive preventative maintenance. Given the vehicle's age and condition, prospective owners should budget for ongoing repairs to address corrosion and wear-related issues.",
