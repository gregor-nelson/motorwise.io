3\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Recent emission failures for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon levels\nFINDINGS:\n- Major defect for exhaust carbon monoxide content at idle exceeding manufacturer's limits (2025)\n- Major defect for exhaust carbon monoxide content after 2nd fast idle exceeding limits (2025)\n- Major defect for exhaust hydrocarbon content after 2nd fast idle exceeding limits (2025)\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Steering Components\nCATEGORY: STEERING\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 3\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Previous issues with steering rack and track rod end components\nFINDINGS:\n- Split steering rack gaiter (nearside) failed MOT in 2014\n- Track rod end ball joint dust covers excessively deteriorated on both sides (2015)\n- Issues affecting the protection of steering components from contamination\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Bodywork and Structure\nCATEGORY: STRUCTURE\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 1\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Previous structural corrosion affecting rear sills\nFINDINGS:\n- Major defect in 2018 for vehicle structure corroded to the extent that rigidity significantly reduced (rear sills)\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Fuel System\nCATEGORY: FUEL\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 1\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: YES\nSUMMARY: Corroded fuel pipes noted in recent MOTs\nFINDINGS:\n- Advisory for corroded fuel pipes in most recent MOTs (2025)\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM: Cooling System\nCATEGORY: COOLING\nSTATUS: WARNING\nISSUE_COUNT: 1\nRECENT_ACTIVITY: NO\nSUMMARY: Previous coolant leak reported\nFINDINGS:\n- Coolant leak noted as a user-entered comment in 2012 MOT\nSYSTEM_END\n\nSYSTEM_ANALYSIS_END\n\nPATTERN_ANALYSIS_START\nRECURRING_ISSUES:\n- Headlamp aim issues appearing repeatedly (2015, 2022, 2025)\n- Brake pipe corrosion has been a consistent issue, progressing from advisories to major defects\n- Suspension ball joint dust covers deterioration pattern spanning multiple years\n- Rear fog lamp functionality and compliance problems recurring\n\nPROGRESSIVE_DETERIORATION:\n- Brake pipes showing increasing corrosion, appearing in multiple locations over time\n- Suspension components showing progressive wear from advisories to failure items\n\nBULLETIN_CORRELATIONS:\n- No technical service bulletins available to correlate with identified issues\nPATTERN_ANALYSIS_END\n\nRISK_FACTORS_START\n- Vehicle age (older Japanese import) contributing to progressive corrosion issues\n- Emission failures in 2025 indicate potential engine performance issues requiring attention\n- Corrosion affecting multiple critical systems (brakes, fuel, structure)\n- High mileage (157,760 miles) with expected wear on major components\n- Previous structural corrosion issues could recur or continue to progress\nRISK_FACTORS_END\n\nPOSITIVE_FACTORS_START\n- Regular MOT testing history shows consistent maintenance\n- Most major defects have been addressed promptly between failed and passed tests\n- No dangerous defects in recent MOTs (last one in 2018 was addressed)\n- Consistent mileage accumulation suggests regular use rather than periods of neglect\nPOSITIVE_FACTORS_END\n\nMAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_START\n- Brake system requires thorough inspection and likely preventative maintenance due to recurring corrosion issues\n- Suspension components should be checked regularly due to pattern of dust cover deterioration\n- Emission system requires diagnostic attention to address recent CO and HC failures\n- Underbody corrosion protection would be beneficial given the history of corrosion issues\n- Regular inspection of fuel pipes recommended due to recent corrosion advisories\nMAINTENANCE_INSIGHTS_END\n\nSUMMARY: This Mazda Eunos has a relatively consistent MOT history from 2006 to 2025, covering an increase from 91,371 to 157,760 miles. The vehicle displays patterns of age and wear-related issues typical for a Japanese import of this era. The most concerning issues include recurring brake pipe corrosion, suspension component wear, and recent emission test failures. The vehicle has had structural corrosion issues in the past (2018) that were addressed, but corrosion continues to affect multiple systems. While the vehicle generally passes its MOT after repairs, the increasing number of advisories on critical systems suggests preventative maintenance should be prioritized. Recent emission failures may indicate engine performance issues requiring diagnostic attention. Overall, the vehicle presents a medium risk profile with expected maintenance needs for a car of this age and mileage.",
