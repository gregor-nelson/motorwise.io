Without this information, no specific system issues can be identified or analysed. As a classic British sports car, the Spitfire typically requires specialist attention regardless of documented history. Potential owners should commission a thorough inspection by a marque specialist, focusing on chassis integrity, rust prevention, and mechanical condition. The lack of MOT history represents a significant unknown factor that should be addressed before purchase through physical inspection and maintenance record verification where possible.",
