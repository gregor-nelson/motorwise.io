						"description": "You only need to inspect vehicles that have not already had the parking brake system tested as the secondary brake.\n\nThese vehicles must instead meet the secondary brake test requirements. For details see Section 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.\n\nThe primary brake tester must be used unless the vehicle is unsuitable due to its drive configuration, transmission type or braking system. If this is the case, a decelerometer or gradient test may be appropriate. A gradient test must only be carried out if the parking brake cannot be tested using the primary brake tester or decelerometer. This will usually only be necessary on certain all-wheel drive vehicles with electronic parking brakes where no vehicle technical information is available.\n\nWhen testing transmission parking brakes, the minimum parking brake efficiency requirement must be calculated before the brake is tested. As soon as the minimum efficiency requirement is reached the brake testing must cease to avoid any possible damage.\n\nA small number of large vehicles, such as some American motor caravans, have a parking brake which is not suitable for a dynamic brake test. In such cases a gradient test must be carried out.\n\nThree-wheeled vehicles only require a parking brake on one wheel.\n\n### Using a roller brake tester\n1. Run the rollers on each axle that has the parking brake fitted and gradually apply the parking brake, keeping any 'hold-on' button or trigger disengaged the whole time.\n\n2. Continue to apply the brake until maximum effort is achieved, or until the wheels lock and slip on the rollers. If the vehicle is ejected from the brake rollers, the required brake efforts may not be achieved, it will be necessary to repeat the test and chock the wheels which are not being tested.\n\n3. Record the reading at which the maximum braking effort is achieved and whether the wheels locked. Stop the rollers if they have not stopped automatically.\n\nLarge vehicles fitted with spring brakes, lock actuators or air assisted parking brakes may require an applied brake test for assessing parking brake efficiency. This test must only be conducted on an approved Class 5 roller brake tester with the appropriate 'Applied Brake Test' programme.\n\n1. Apply the parking brake fully and then release any power assistance. The service brake may be used to assist in setting the parking brake.\n\n2. Start each brake roller in turn and note the recorded maximum effort.\n\n### Using a plate brake tester\n1. Drive the vehicle forwards at a steady speed of about 4mph up to the plate tester.\n\n2. As soon as the wheels are on the plate's high friction braking surfaces, gradually apply the parking brake, keeping any \"hold-on\" button or trigger disengaged the whole time, until maximum effort is achieved.\n\n3. Note the maximum values achieved.\n\nIf a vehicle fails any aspect of the plate brake test, the check should be repeated to confirm the result.\n\n### Using a decelerometer\nIf the vehicle or system cannot be tested on a roller brake tester, set up the decelerometer in the vehicle as instructed by the equipment manufacturer.\n\n1. Drive the vehicle on a level road at a steady speed of approximately 20mph (32kph) and progressively apply the parking brake to maximum.\n\n2. Note the recorded brake efficiency.\n\nDecelerometer brake testing must always be carried out on suitable roads with as little traffic as possible. A particular public road should not be used for tests so frequently that it could cause complaints from residents.\n\n### Using a gradient tester\nA gradient test must only be carried out on vehicles that are not suitable for a parking brake test with the primary brake tester or decelerometer. This will usually only be necessary on certain all-wheel drive vehicles with electronic parking brakes where no vehicle technical information is available.\n\nA suitable gradient is considered to be one which:\n- is longer than the wheelbase of the vehicle\n- is not more than 16%\n- is as close to 16% as possible within a 3 mile radius of the testing station\n- if on a public road is in a safe place to conduct the test\n\n1. Reverse the vehicle onto the gradient.\n\n2. Hold the vehicle on the service brake whilst setting the parking brake.\n\n3. Release the service brake and note if the vehicle is held on the gradient.\n\n### Brake test results\nFor details of entering brake test results see Section 1.2.2.",

Otherwise, take the weight from a weight data chart or some other reliable source.\n\nFor quadricycles and three-wheeled vehicles in Class 4 with two brake controls, one control must achieve an efficiency of at least 30% and the other control 25%.\n\nThe efficiency calculation for each control is the total from the wheel(s) when operated by that control only.\n\nIf the vehicle can be tested using the RBT, test the brakes in the normal way and note the readings.\n\nManually calculate the service brake test results. Note: the percentage efficiency for each control still has to be met.\n\nEfficiency % = (Total brake effort from control 1)/(Vehicle test weight) x 100\nEfficiency % = (Total brake effort from control 2)/(Vehicle test weight) x 100\n\nFor Class 7 use the DGW from the manufacture's plate or, the nominal DGW of 2,600kg if using a plate brake tester and the presented weight is less than 2,000kg.\n\nFor Class 5 use the lesser of the DGW or maximum authorised mass (MAM) from the manufacturer's plate. On vehicles where only the ULW is displayed, you must calculate the DGW by multiplying the number of passenger seats by 63.5kg (or 140lbs) and adding the ULW, for example: \n52 seats × 63.5kg = 3302kg + 5,250kg ULW = 8552kg\n\nWhen conducting a test on a roller brake tester (RBT) where more than half of the wheels of a brake system lock the efficiency requirements for that system are considered to be met.\n\n### Efficiency requirements\nFor vehicle category definitions see the 'Abbreviations and definitions' in the 'Introduction'.\n\nM1 vehicles having a service brake operating on at least 4 wheels and which were first used on or after 1 September 2010: 58% efficiency requirement\n\nM1 vehicles having a service brake operating on at least 4 wheels and which were first used before 1 September 2010: 50% efficiency requirement\n\nN1 vehicles: 50% efficiency requirement\n\nM2 and M3 vehicles having a service brake operating on at least 4 wheels which were first used on or after 1 January 1968: 50% efficiency requirement\n\nM2 and M3 vehicles having a service brake operating on at least 4 wheels which were first used before 1 January 1968: 45% efficiency requirement\n\nL2 and L6 vehicles with a single service brake control that operates the brakes on all wheels: 40% efficiency requirement\n\nL5 vehicles with a single service brake control that operates the brakes on all wheels which were first used on or after 1 January 1968: 50% efficiency requirement\n\nL5 vehicles with a single service brake control that operates the brakes on all wheels which were first used before 1 January 1968: 40% efficiency requirement\n\nL7 vehicles with a single service brake control that operates the brakes on all wheels: 50% efficiency requirement\n\nVehicles first used before 1 January 1968 which do NOT have one means of control operating on at least 4 wheels and which have one brake system with two means of control or two brake systems with separate means of control: 30% from 1st means of control, 25% from 2nd means of control\n\nAny L category vehicle with two service brake systems each having a separate means of operation: 30% from 1st means of control, 25% from 2nd means of control\n\nVehicles first used before 1 January 1915 only require one efficient braking system: No specific requirement\n\n### Brake test results\nBrake efforts achieved during a test should be entered on the MOT testing service as follows:\n\nRoller and plate brake tests:\n\n1. Enter the brake effort from each wheel and whether they 'lock-up'. The MOT testing service will automatically calculate the brake efficiency and out of balance results\n\n2. Enter other defects manually.\n\nThere is no provision in MTS to calculate the service brake test results for quadricycles or three-wheeled vehicles in Class 4 with two brake controls.\n\nBrake test results for Quadricycles:\n\nOn the 'Brake test configuration' screen, select dual braking system.\n\nOn the 'Add brake test results' screen, for quadricycles enter the actual brake readings for both axles and manually calculate the efficiency for each control.\n\nRecord the service brake readings indicating that all wheels have locked, regardless of whether wheels have actually locked.\n\nBrake test results for Class 4 Three-wheeled vehicles:\n\nThe recording of these vehicles is the same as for quadricycles.\n\nOn the 'Add brake test results' screen divide the reading for the single wheel by 2 and enter this figure in both boxes for the axle with the single wheel.\n\nIf the 30% or the 25% requirements have not been met, the service brake result is a fail, enter a manual failure for brake efficiency as follows:\n\nAdd a defect:\n\n1. Select 'Brakes - Brake performance – Service brake performance – RBT'\n\n2. Select 'Service brake efficiency (trikes, quads and pre-68 vehicles)'\n\n3. Select 'Service brake efficiency below requirements'\n\nIn the comments box state which control has failed acting on which axle.\n\nPlate brake tests:\n\n1. Enter the brake effort from each wheel. The MOT testing service will automatically calculate brake efficiency and out of balance results.\n\n2. Enter other defects manually.\n\nDecelerometer tests:\n\n1. Enter the efficiencies recorded by the meter. The MOT testing service will automatically pass or fail the vehicle on brake efficiency.\n\n2. Enter other defects manually.\n\nIf the MOT testing service is unavailable, refer to the latest edition of the MOT Testing Guide.\n\nIn cases where the required brake efficiency is only just met, but the tester knows that a higher performance figure is normally obtained for the vehicle type, the vehicle presenter should be informed.",

				"description": "You must ensure that the vehicle is in a safe condition for the test to be carried out.\n\nThe primary brake tester must be used unless the vehicle is unsuitable due to its drive configuration, transmission type or braking system. If this is the case, a full or partial decelerometer test may be appropriate. You should consider any additional information from the vehicle manufacturer.\n\nWhen conducting a test on a roller brake tester (RBT) where more than half of the wheels of a brake system lock the efficiency requirements for that system are considered to be met.\n\nAlternatively, the efficiency requirements are met if the front wheels lock on the service brake of an unladen Class 7 vehicle with at least a 100kg force at each rear wheel for a two-axle vehicle, or at least 50kg force at each rear wheel on a three-axle vehicle.\n\nWhen testing using an Automated RBT or a plate brake tester, the vehicle test weight for Classes 3 and 4 is the weight shown by the brake test equipment.\n\nFor non-automated roller brake testers the brake test weight must be obtained from a brake data chart or other reliable source.\n\nFor Class 7 use the DGW from the manufacture's plate or, the nominal DGW of 2,600kg if using a plate brake tester and the presented weight is less than 2,000kg.\n\nFor Class 5 use the lesser of the DGW or maximum authorised mass (MAM) from the manufacturer's plate. On vehicles where only the ULW is displayed, you must calculate the DGW by multiplying the number of passenger seats by 63.5kg and adding the ULW, for example: 52 seats × 63.5kg = 3302kg + 5,250kg ULW = 8552kg.\n\nVehicles of unknown test weight can be tested on either an RBT or plate brake tester (PBT). However, if the number of wheel locks are not achieved for any system on a non-ATL RBT, a decelerometer test must be used to establish the overall brake efficiency of the relevant system(s).\n\nCertain converted passenger vehicles, such as motor caravans and ambulances, may have a kerb weight greatly in excess of the base model weight displayed by the MOT testing service. In these circumstances, the vehicle should be treated as having an unknown test weight.\n\nAdditional braking devices, such as electronic retarders, should not be operated during the brake test.\n\nSome tricycles with two brake controls may have a linked braking system. The brake force used in the efficiency calculation is the total from all wheels when operated by that control only.\n\n### Using a roller brake tester\nEnsure that the vehicle, or system, under test is suitable for testing using a roller brake tester. If the vehicle or system is unsuitable, it should be tested with a decelerometer.\n\n### ATL test procedure\nAutomated test lane (ATL) approved test stations should position the front wheels of the vehicle in the rollers of the brake tester and follow the sequence of instructions as displayed and prompted on screen. If a vehicle is ejected from the brake rollers, the required brake efforts may not be achieved. In such cases the test should be repeated in manual mode, running each roller individually.\n\n### Non - ATL test procedure\nYou are permitted to use an alternative procedure to that specified below as long as all the testable elements are adequately covered.\n\n1. Position the wheels of the first axle to be tested in the brake rollers and then run both sets of rollers together in a forward direction until the vehicle is aligned. With the rollers still running, note whether a significant brake effort is recorded from any wheel without a brake being applied.\n\n2. Gradually apply the service brake and watch how the braking effort for each wheel increases. Stopping short of lock up or maximum effort, hold a steady pedal pressure and check there is no excessive brake effort fluctuation with each revolution of the road wheel.\n\n3. Gradually release the service brake and observe how the braking effort at each wheel reduces.\n\n4. Gradually depress the service brake again, this time until maximum effort is achieved, or until the wheel locks and slips on the rollers. Stop the rollers.\n\n5. Record the reading at which the maximum braking effort is achieved and whether brake \"lock-up\" occurs. Stop the rollers if they have not stopped automatically.\n\n6. Place the wheels of the next axle in the brake rollers and repeat the above procedure.\n\nWhen checking maximum effort, testers can elect to run the brake rollers individually or together, depending on the suitability of the RBT. However, if the rollers are run together and the vehicle fails to meet the minimum performance requirement, the test must be repeated running the rollers individually.\n\nIf both rollers are run together, it will almost certainly be necessary to chock the wheels that are not being tested.\n\n### Using a plate brake tester\nFor vehicles other than Class 7, establish the actual presented weight of the vehicle.\n\nFor Class 7 vehicles, the brake efficiency will be calculated using one of the following:\n- the actual design gross weight (DGW) where the presented weight is at least 2,000kg (the DGW is obtained from the manufacturer's plate fitted to the vehicle)\n- a nominal DGW figure of 2,600kg if the presented weight is less than 2,000kg\n\nTo use a plate brake tester:\n\n1. Enter the appropriate data to conduct the test.\n\n2. For each check, drive the vehicle forwards at a steady speed of about 4mph up to the plate tester.\n\n3. On the first run, just before the wheels are on the plate high friction surfaces, apply a light constant pressure to the brake pedal. Do not stop on the tester. Take note of the way the brake efforts fluctuate.\n\n4. On the second run, as soon as the wheels are on the plate high friction braking surfaces, apply the service brake progressively until maximum effort is achieved.\n\n5. Take note of the way the brake efforts increase and the maximum values achieved.\n\nIf a vehicle fails any aspect of the plate brake test, the check should be repeated to confirm the result."

If this would result in failure for beam aim being too low, you should re-check the beam aim with the control set at its 'highest' position.\n\nOn vehicles with hydro-pneumatic suspension systems, it's necessary to have the engine running when checking headlamp aim.\n\nTo check the aim:\n1.

				"title": "Tyres",
				"description": "You only need to inspect the tyres fitted to the road wheels at the time of the inspection. If you notice a defect on a spare tyre, you should advise the vehicle presenter.\n\n#### Size\nThe aspect ratio of a tyre is included in the size marking. For example, a 215/55R15 has an aspect ratio of 55%.\n\n'Standard' car tyres have a nominal aspect ratio of 82% (unless marked otherwise) and these are almost identical in size to tyres with an aspect ratio of 80%. They can be safely mixed in any configuration on a vehicle.\n\nSome tyres may be marked with two sizes. For example, a 185/75R14 tyre may be dual marked 185R14. In such cases, you can accept either marking.\n\n#### Load rating - Classes 5 and 7 only\nA tyre load rating table is in Appendix B.\n\nMake sure the tyre load rating is suitable for the axle weight.\n\nYou can find the permitted maximum laden weight of an axle on the manufacturer's plate.\n\nIf axle weights are not displayed on the manufacturer's plate, you must assume that the load capacity of the tyres are suitable, unless there's indisputable evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nIf a goods vehicle has a 'Ministry' plate showing lower axle weights not to be exceeded in Great Britain, you must use those instead of the ones on the manufacturer's plate.\n\n#### Speed rating - Classes 5 and 7 only\nA tyre's speed rating is shown on the sidewall as a letter and usually precedes or follows the load rating. Speed ratings from A to K are unacceptable, with the exception of H.\n\nIf no speed rating is shown it must be assumed that the minimum requirements are met.\n\n#### Load ratings for low speed rated tyres - Class 5 vehicles only\nTyres must be suitable for use up to 70mph (L speed rating) unless the vehicle is a 'restricted speed vehicle'.\n\nIf the tyre can carry the maximum permitted axle weight of the vehicle, these vehicles can use tyres with a lower speed rating tyres up to 70mph as follows:\n* K speed rating – but the tyre's carrying capacity is reduced by 3%\n* J speed rating – but the tyre's carrying capacity is reduced by 7%\n\nFor example, K speed rating tyres can be used at 70mph if the load is reduced as follows:\n146/143K = 6,000kg single or 10,900kg dual - less 3% = 5,820kg single or 10,580kg dual\n\nYou must not accept a tyre load rating that's less than the maximum permitted axle weight.\n\n#### Structure\nTyres of different types of structure, such as radial-ply and cross-ply, must not be mixed on the same axle.\nSteel and fabric radial-ply tyres are considered to be the same structure.\n\nRun flat and conventional tyres can be mixed on the same axle, although this is not recommended.\n\n#### Condition and fitment\nEvidence of a tyre contacting a part of the vehicle, such as due to tyre flexing or suspension movement, is not considered to be a defect. A vehicle should only be rejected if the tyre is fouling a part of the vehicle at the time of test.\n\nSome vehicles have lock stops comprising rubbing pads on the body that the front tyres may contact on a full lock. These are acceptable if they are properly maintained so that they do not damage the tyres.\n\nWhen assessing cuts in a tyre, it is permissible to check whether a cut is deep enough to reach the ply or cord by using a blunt instrument to open the cut taking care not to cause further damage.\n\nThe following criteria should be used when assessing a cut in a tyre:\n* any ply or cord that can be seen without touching the tyre - fail\n* if by folding back rubber or opening a cut with a blunt instrument, so as not to cause further damage, exposed ply or cord can be seen irrespective of the size of the cut - fail\n* if a cut which is more than 25mm or 10% of the section width whichever is the greater, is opened with a blunt instrument and cords can be felt but not seen - fail\n\nBefore failing a cut, you must make sure it's the cords that you can feel not a foreign object. If you're not sure, then you should pass and advise.\n\nWhen assessing lumps or bulges in a radial ply tyre, care should be taken to distinguish between normal undulations in the carcass, resulting from manufacturing, and lumps or bulges caused by structural deterioration.\n\nTake extra care with stretched tyres because they're more prone to sidewall damage.\n\nRecut tyres are only permitted on:\n* vehicles over 3,050kg ULW\n* goods vehicles with an ULW of at least 2,540kg having at least 16 inch (405mm) diameter wheels\n* passenger vehicles with an ULW of at least 2,540kg having 8 or more passenger seats\n\nYou should only accept tyres with NHS, Not for Highway Use or similar markings if they have an 'E' marking and a number contained within a circle. Adjacent to this circle, the sidewall must also be marked with a six digit number, which may be preceded by 75R or similar marking.\n\nDirection of rotation may be indicated by an arrow and/or words, but an arrow by itself should not be taken to indicate direction of rotation.\n\nAsymmetric tyres are marked with correct fitment information on the sidewall, such as 'outside'. However, if an asymmetric tyre is fitted the wrong way around it is not to be considered a reason for rejection. The presenter should be advised.\n\n#### Tread depth\nA tread pattern is the combination of plain surfaces and grooves extending across the breadth of the tread and round the entire circumference. It excludes any tie-bars, tread wear indicators, or features designed to wear out substantially before the remainder of the pattern, and other minor features.\n\nIn simple terms, grooves containing tread wear indicators (TWI) or grooves cut as deep as those containing the wear indicators when new, are considered to be primary grooves. Other grooves or sipes that are not cut as deep as the primary grooves are secondary grooves and are not to be considered when assessing tread depth.\n\nThe 'breadth of tread' is the part of the tyre which can contact the road under normal conditions of use measured at 90 degrees to the peripheral line of the tread.\n\nDifferent vehicles require different tread depths.\n\nThe following vehicles first used on or after 3 January 1933 need 1.6mm tread depth:\n* passenger vehicles with a maximum of 8 passenger seats, excluding the driver's seat\n* goods vehicles or dual-purpose vehicles not exceeding 3,500kg DGW\n* tricycles with an ULW more than 410kg and all quadricycles\n\nThe primary grooves of the tread pattern must be at least 1.6mm deep within the central three-quarters of the breadth of tread and around the entire outer circumference of the tyre.\n\nEither side of the central three-quarters of the tyre can be devoid of tread ('bald').\n\nThe following vehicles must have 1.0mm tread depth:\n* vehicles first used before 3 January 1933\n* passenger vehicles with more than 8 passenger seats excluding the driver's seat\n* tricycles with an ULW not exceeding 410kg with an engine capacity greater than 50cc\n* tricycles with an ULW not exceeding 410kg which are electrically powered\n\nThe tread pattern must be visible over the whole tread area, and have a depth of at least 1.0mm throughout a single band of at least three-quarters over any section of the breadth of tread round the entire outer circumference of the tyre.\n\nThe 1.0mm tread depth requirement applies to the whole tread width if the original tread pattern did not extend beyond three-quarters of the tyre width when new.\n\nTricycles with an ULW not exceeding 410kg with an engine capacity not greater than 50cc do not need to have 1mm of tread. However, they must have a visible tread pattern around the entire circumference and across the whole breadth of the tread.\n\n#### Tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS)\nThe inspection of the tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is for M1 vehicles first used on or after 1 January 2012.\n\nThe TPMS warning lamp will generally illuminate and go off again when the ignition is switched on. If the system has identified a previous pressure loss, the lamp will remain illuminated. This does not automatically mean the system has a malfunction. In the event of a system malfunction, the lamp may flash a number of times and then remain on.\n\nWarning messages on dashboard displays are not a defect in their own right, but may assist the tester in determining that the warning lamp is illuminated because a malfunction exists.\n\nIf it is unclear the warning lamp is indicating a system malfunction and not a simply indicating that one or more tyre pressures are low, then advisory information should be added to the test result.\n\n### Tyre age\nThe check of tyre age applies to all vehicles with more than 8 passenger seats, other than vehicles of historical interest.\n\nTyre age is determined by the date code on the sidewall and will be a three or four-digit code. Tyres with a three-digit code will be more than 10 years old.\n\nThe code is usually located in a 'window' on the sidewall and may or may not be located at the end of the DOT number.\n\nThe first two digits of the code represent the week of manufacture of the tyre and the second two digits represent the year of manufacture. In the example above, the tyre was manufactured in week 35 of 2016.\n\nTyres over ten years old at the time of test must be failed if they are on:\n* any front steered axle\n* any rear axle of a minibus with a single wheel fitment.\n\nTyres not displaying a date code must also be failed. However, date codes are only required to be marked on one side of the tyre so it may not be possible to see the date code on twin wheel fitments. Under these circumstances you should advise the presenter and assume the date code is present and the tyre age is acceptable.\n\nOn tyres where the date code is illegible, for example, due to kerbing or deliberate tampering, a major or minor defect must be recorded, depending on the location of the tyre.\n\n### Retreaded tyres\nRemoulded/retreaded tyres may have two date codes. One being the original code and the other being the date of retreading. In this case the most recent date code must be used.\n\nThe appearance of the date code on retreaded tyres may be different from the original date code and may be branded rather than moulded.",

Use an assistant to shake the wheels as per item 3, whilst observing the relevant components.\n\n#### Method of jacking\nVehicles with front suspension types that have the torsion bar or spring force acting on the lower suspension arm must be jacked under the lower suspension arm so that the suspension spring force is removed from the ball joints as shown.\n\nBeam axles should be jacked under the beam.\n\nAll other suspension types must be jacked so the suspension hangs freely.\n\n### Rear axles\nEnsure the jacking equipment is positioned to allow the safe examination of components without risk of injury or damage to the vehicle.\n\nUse your experience and judgement when positioning the jacking equipment to ensure that suspension spring force is removed from components to allow a proper examination for wear/play.\n\nOn some vehicles it may be necessary to jack in more than one position to carry out a full examination.\n\nYou do not need to jack the rear wheels of vehicles with a DGW more than 5,000kg.",

Any signs of overstretching will be a deficiency.\nCuts on either side of the webbing in excess of 2mm are likely to reduce the webbing strength significantly and will be deemed a deficiency.\nAway from the webbing edges where cuts and damage have a lesser effect on the tensile strength, only cuts or damage obviously in excess of 4mm shall be considered a deficiency.\nCuts anywhere on a child seat belt will be deemed a deficiency.\nYou must check any visible parts of all seat belts fitted. This includes:\n\n- seat belts fitted to child seats and restraints (this only applies to child seats and restraints that are securely attached to the vehicle using Isofix, carabiners, ratchet straps, nuts and bolts etc)\n- any disabled persons belts or wheelchairs straps\n\nYou do not need to inspect:\n\n- a belt fitted with no corresponding seat\n- a buckle or stalk with no corresponding belt\n\nYou should lift folded seats to inspect seat belts. However, you do not have to do this if you'd need tools to do it. If you cannot lift seats because there are heavy or fragile items on the seat, you can refuse to test the vehicle. For details, see item 4d in the Introduction.\nYou do not need to inspect buckles or stalks with no corresponding belt.\nWhere a child seat is fitted that prevents access to the seat belt buckle, you must check as much of the seat belt as possible and issue an advisory that the buckle could not be checked.\nTo check the belt buckle:\n\n1. Fasten the belt locking mechanism.\n2. Try to pull the locked sections apart.\n3. Press the release mechanism while pulling on the belt.\n4. Make sure the mechanism releases when required.\n\nFor retracting seat belts, check that excess webbing is wound into the retracting unit with the mechanism fastened and the seat unoccupied. Check this with the seat base set in its rearmost position.\nSome types of retracting belt might need manual help before they retract. If a temporary device is fitted to prevent retraction, you can remove it.\nA seat belt installation check might be required on vehicles fitted with more than 8 passenger seats first used before 1 October 2001. If you're not sure, see Section 10 of this inspection manual.\nChild seat(s) retained by seat belt(s) must not be removed. A visual examination is required of only those parts of the seat belt(s) which are readily accessible.\nFitment\nSeat belts are not needed for:\n\n- seats that are only used when the vehicle is stationary, such as a sofa in the living area of a motor caravan\n- side facing seats\n- occasional seats that fold down when not in use\n\nFor further information see the tables in Appendix C to determine which seats need a seat belt.",

If you know that the vehicle has a speed limiter fitted, then it must meet the requirements of this inspection.\nIf a vehicle has been modified, such as by changing the rear axle ratio so that it will no longer be able to go faster than 100km/h, the vehicle must have a signed declaration showing the details of the modification. It should not be possible for the driver to switch off the speed limiter while driving. However, speed limiters wired through ignition switches are acceptable.\nTamperproof devices might be for example mechanical and electrical connections that can be only used with special tools, normally only available from vehicle or component manufacturers for disconnection or adjustment purposes. These are acceptable instead of other types of tamperproof devices such as seals, lock nuts, pins, wires, plastic inserts, sealing compound or sealing paint on mechanical and electrical connections.\nModern tamperproof devices are electronic and cannot be checked.\nYou should get the vehicle's DGW from the manufacturer's plate.\nFor vehicles first used before 1 April 1982 not fitted with a manufacturer's plate, you should instead calculate the laden weight by following these steps:\n\n1. Multiply the maximum number of passengers and crew, excluding the driver, by 63.5kg.\n2. Add the kerb or unladen weight displayed on the side of the vehicle.\n\nA speed limiter plate must be securely fixed somewhere easy to see in the driver's compartment.

On some vehicles it will be necessary to start the engine before the MIL goes off.\nYou need to inspect MIL fitted to:\n\n- petrol vehicles including hybrids with 4 or more wheels, not more than 8 passenger seats in addition to the driver's seat and first used on or after 1 July 2003\n- petrol vehicles including hybrids with 4 or more wheels, more than 8 passenger seats in addition to the driver's seat and first used on or after 1 July 2008\n- gas and bi-fuel vehicles including hybrids with 4 or more wheels, not more than 8 passenger seats in addition to the driver's seat and first used on or after 1 July 2008\n\nKit cars, amateur built vehicles and American pickups are not required to be fitted with an engine MIL.\nVisual inspection (all vehicles):\nRaise the engine speed to around 2500rpm or half the maximum engine speed if this is lower. Hold the engine speed steady for approximately 20 seconds and allow the engine to return to its natural idle speed.\nOnce the idle speed has stabilised assess the smoke emitted from the tailpipe. If the exhaust is emitting dense blue or clearly visible black smoke then the vehicle will fail the test.\nIn exceptional cases, especially on certain vehicles manufactured before 1960 where emissions of smoke are unavoidable due to the engine design, these vehicles will not fail the test.\nVehicles with two stroke engines also emit smoke that is not avoidable and should not be failed unless the exhaust emits excessive dense blue or clearly visible black smoke during acceleration which would obscure the view of other road users.\nThis test may be done in conjunction with the check of the vehicles noise suppression system Section 8.1.1\nEmissions testing\nYou must inspect vehicles with spark ignition engines first used on or after 1 August 1975.\nYou do not need to check:\n\n- L category vehicles\n- hybrid vehicles - with electric and combustion engines\n- hydrogen fuel cell vehicles\n- two-stroke engines - unless they are subject to a catalyst test\n\nIf an engine has been modified in any way, it still must meet the exhaust emission requirements according to the age of the vehicle.\nFor emissions purposes only you should treat the following as first used before 1 August 1975:\n\n- kit cars and amateur-built vehicles first used before 1 August 1998\n- Wankel rotary-engined vehicles first used before 1 August 1987\n- Q plated vehicles\n\nTo prevent the build-up of fumes, the test should be carried out in a well-ventilated area.\nPersonal imports\nA personal import must be tested according to its date of first use. However, if you're shown a letter from the vehicle manufacturer proving that the engine does not meet British emission standards you must test to the next lower emission standard.\nFor example, a 1995 car first used in Gambia with a letter from the engine manufacturer stating the engine number and showing that the engine cannot meet catalyst emission limits, you must use the non-cat limits of carbon monoxide (CO) 3.5% and hydrocarbons (HC) 1,200ppm.\nVehicles fitted with a different engine\nIf a vehicle first used before 1 September 2002 is fitted with an engine that's older than the vehicle, you must test it to the standards applicable for the engine. The vehicle presenter must have proof of the age of the engine.\nIf a vehicle first used on or after 1 September 2002 is fitted with a different engine, you must test it to the emissions standards for the age of the vehicle.\nFor emission standards on kit cars, read further.\nKit cars\nKit cars and amateur-built vehicles first used on or after 1 August 1998 must have either Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) or Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA).\nYou must test kit cars or amateur built vehicles to the limits in the vehicle's registration document (V5c). If the V5c does not show any limits, you must test it to the limits of the engine fitted at the time of the SVA or IVA test.\nVehicles exempt from emission limits\nSome vehicles may never have been able to meet the MOT limits for CO or HC emissions. The vehicle owner must provide proof of this, such as a letter from the vehicle manufacturer. If the vehicle owner cannot provide proof of this, you must fail the MOT test if the vehicle is not within the emissions limits.\nPassenger cars\nA 'passenger car' is a vehicle that:\n\n- is constructed or adapted to carry passengers\n- has up to 5 passenger seats, excluding the driver's seat\n- has a DGW not exceeding 2,500kg\n- is not a goods vehicle, such as a pick-up or a car-derived van\n\nIf you're not sure if a vehicle is a passenger car, you can confirm it by:\n\n- getting the DGW from the manufacturer's VIN plate\n- checking if the vehicle is listed in section 2 of the current emissions data book\n- checking the owner's handbook or a data book\n\nIf you cannot find proof that the vehicle is a passenger car, you must assume it's not a passenger car.\nSpecialist conversions\nFor emissions purposes, you must treat specialist conversions as if they had not been converted.\nFor example, a motor caravan or ambulance converted from a goods vehicle is still to be treated as not being a passenger car, whereas an ambulance converted to a goods vehicle, or a passenger car with seats added is still to be treated as being a passenger car.\nSimilarly, a vehicle originally built with 6 or more passenger seats, in addition to the driver, which has had seats removed must be still treated as not being a passenger car.\nTesting dual exhaust systems\nA dual exhaust system has 2 separate pipes from the engine manifold to the tailpipes.\nYou need to average the emissions from both tailpipes - even if the system has a balance tube between the separate pipes.\nTo average the emissions, you add both readings together and divide by 2.\nFor example:\n\n- 1st pipe emits 0.3% CO and 200 ppm HC\n- 2nd pipe emits 0.1% CO and 150 ppm HC\n\nIf a vehicle has an exhaust holed to the extent that it will fail its MOT, you should recheck the emissions when the exhaust is repaired even if the vehicle does not leave the testing station. You should tell the vehicle presenter that any emission readings taken with a leaking exhaust might be incorrect.\nVehicles which run on more than one fuel, such as petrol and LPG, should be tested on the fuel they are running on when presented.\nTesting LPG engines\nThe hydrocarbon (HC) emissions on vehicles running on LPG are propane and not hexane. The HC reading obtained must therefore be divided by the 'propane/hexane equivalency factor' (PEF) marked on the gas analyser.\nFor example: If the HC reading = 180 ppm and the PEF marked on the machine is 0.48.\nEmission limits\nUse the flowcharts 1, 2 and 3 to decide which emission test is applicable for the vehicle being tested. Follow the flowcharts and notes carefully as early catalyst equipped vehicles may not need a 'CAT' test.\nSome vehicles give unstable readings due, for example, to their carburettor or fuel injection system design. Before failing a vehicle, make sure that a particular limit has been exceeded constantly for at least 5 seconds.\nSome vehicles give unstable readings. Make sure you test the emissions level for at least 5 seconds.\nChart 1. Emissions limits for vehicles first used on or after 1 August 1975\n*See chart 2 for passenger cars first on or after 1 August 1992\nChart 2. Emissions limits of passenger cars first used on or after 1 August 1992\nChart 3. Emissions limits of non-passenger cars first used on or after 1 August 1992\nNon-catalyst test\nYou must:\n\n- measure the exhaust gas for at least 5 seconds at idle\n- determine the proportion of carbon monoxide (CO)\n- determine the proportion of hydrocarbons (HC) - you do not need to do this for vehicles using compressed natural gas (CNG)\n\nDuring the test, make sure:\n\n- the engine is idling normally - if this is not possible, you can use light throttle pedal pressure\n- the engine is warm\n- any enrichment device, like a choke, is not operating\n- there is not significant electrical loading, such as heated seats or heated rear windows\n\nYou must deduct any residual hydrocarbons from the HC reading. Residual hydrocarbons are those that are picked up by the analyser when it samples clean air.\nIf a vehicle meets the CO requirement at its normal idling speed but fails the HC check, apply light pressure to the throttle and re-check the HC level at a high idle speed of about 2,000rpm. If the HC reading is then 1,200ppm or less, the vehicle will meet both the CO and HC requirements.\nBasic emissions test\nEnsure a daily leak test has been carried out.\nMake sure the engine is hot. If the engine is not hot, raise the engine speed to between 2,000rpm and 3,000rpm until it's up to normal operating temperature.\nYou can tell that the engine is hot from any of the following:\n\n- the temperature gauge\n- the cooling fan has cut in\n- the cooling hoses are hot\n\nTo do the emissions test:\n\n- Make sure the engine is idling normally - to check this use the vehicle tachometer or attach an engine speed measuring device.\n- Do a HC hang-up check to make sure that HC is less than 20ppm.\n- Insert the analyser probe into the exhaust.\n- Raise the engine speed to between 2,500rpm and 3,000rpm and hold it steady.\n- Record the CO, HC and lambda readings.\n- Allow the engine speed to return to idle (between 450rpm and 1,500rpm).\n- Record the CO reading.\n\nTo pass the basic emissions test, the readings must be within all the following limits:\n\n- CO up to 0.2% at fast idle (2,500rpm to 3,000rpm)\n- HC up to 200ppm at fast idle (2,500rpm to 3,000rpm)\n- Lambda between 0.97 and 1.03 at fast idle (2,500rpm to 3,000rpm)\n- CO up to 0.3% at idle (450rpm to 1,500rpm)\n\nIf the vehicle passes the test, the VTS must keep a readily retrievable record for 3 months. The customer must be provided with a printout of the result if one is requested.\nIf the vehicle does not pass the basic emissions test, you need to:\n\n- Enter the vehicle's details into the analyser.\n- Use the testing flow charts to check which test to do next.\n- Carry out either a full catalyst test or a non-catalyst test as appropriate.\n\nFull catalyst test\nUse the flowcharts 1, 2 and 3 within this section to establish which emissions test and limits you must use for the vehicle under test.\nUse the vehicle exhaust emission standards or use the EGA database to find any specific limits for the vehicle.\nYou might need the following details to find the vehicle's exact limits:\n\n- vehicle make\n- vehicle model\n- model code\n- engine code\n- engine size\n- VIN\n\nIf you can find an exact match other than the model or engine code, use the lesser of the vehicle's specific limits or default limits.\nIf you cannot find an exact match, test it to default limits.\nTo carry out the full catalyst test:\n\n- Connect the engine speed and oil temperature measuring devices. If you can measure the engine speed only after removing a cosmetic engine cover, you must remove the cover if it's easily un-clipped and then carry out the speed measurement. If the engine speed cannot be measured, you should use the vehicle tachometer if fitted. Otherwise you can by-pass the engine speed measurement and make an estimate.\n- Check the engine oil temperature. If it's below the minimum vehicle specific requirement, raise the engine speed to between 2,000rpm and 3,000rpm and maintain this speed until the minimum engine oil temperature has been reached. Remove temperature measuring probe and replace dipstick.\n- Engine oil temperature must be measured whenever possible, using the approved device. If in exceptional circumstances the engine oil temperature cannot be measured, check that the temperature gauge indicated that the engine was at its normal operating temperature, the cooling fan had cut in, or the coolant pipes were hot.\n- Perform a HC hang-up check and ensure that HC is less than 20ppm before continuing.

					"description": "Engine malfunction indicator lamp (engine management light or 'EML')\nTurn on the ignition and check that the engine malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminates and then goes off. On some vehicles it will be necessary to start the engine before the MIL goes off.\nYou need to inspect MIL fitted to diesel vehicles including hybrids with 4 or more wheels and first used on or after 1 July 2008.\nKit cars, amateur built vehicles and American pickups are not required to be fitted with an engine MIL.\nOpacity test\nThis inspection is not for 'L' category vehicles or electric/combustion engine (hybrid) vehicles.\nAn approved diesel smoke meter (DSM) will be needed to perform this inspection on vehicles first used on or after 1 January 1980.\nThe probe on some types of smoke meter must be correctly aligned with the exhaust gas flow. You may have to check the smoke meter manufacturer's instructions.\nDo not do a smoke test if the engine is not in a safe condition. You must make sure it's safe by asking the vehicle presenter and carrying out a brief examination of the engine.\nThe smoke test should not be carried out if:\n\n- there is insufficient oil in the engine\n- the engine oil pressure is too low\n- there is abnormal engine noise\n- the governor has been tampered with\n- the camshaft belt is in an unsatisfactory condition\n\nIf you judge it to be unsafe to conduct the smoke test, you must show the reason for refusing to carry out the test on the VT30 (see item 4h in Introduction).\nOn vehicles first used before 1980 the engine should be at its normal operating temperature. You can check this from the temperature gauge, cooling fan switching on and off or by feeling hot coolant hoses.\nVehicles first used after 1980 vehicles must have an instrumented smoke test and it's important to ensure the engine is at least 80°C or normal operating temperature if lower, before carrying out the test. You should check the engine temperature with an engine oil temperature probe or other approved device.\nIf due to the vehicle design, or where oil temperature measurement is impractical, the engine's normal operating temperature may be checked by other means, such as the operation of the engine cooling fan. It is not normally sufficient to run the engine with the vehicle stationary to warm it up to temperature.\nWhen testing vehicles with automatic transmission you must take care to avoid overheating the transmission system. Do not carry out unnecessary engine acceleration or prolonged high revving of the engine. You may have to check the vehicle manufacturer's instructions.\nIf a vehicle has a dual exhaust system, you must repeat the smoke test and average the emissions from the tailpipes. To average the emissions, you add both readings together and divide by 2.\nFor example:\n\n- first pipe emits smoke level of 1.50m-1\n- second pipe emits smoke level of 1.00m-1\n\nA dual exhaust system has 2 separate pipes from the engine manifold to the tailpipes. Even if there is a balance tube between the separate pipes it's still considered a dual exhaust.\nMaximum engine revs cannot be achieved on some vehicles due to design features. If this is the case, the vehicle must be tested as presented. Such vehicles, as well as some with low emission diesel engines (mainly Euro IV and onwards) may fail to trigger a reading on the DSM.\nIf you cannot get a reading or the DSM shows an error, you must make a manual record to show that the emissions limits were tested and met but the DSM could not register the reading.\nIf you cannot register the results in the meter, write down the following details and keep them for 3 months:\n\n- test station number\n- tester's name\n- date and time\n- test number\n- vehicle type\n- vehicle registration number\n- that the vehicle passed the emissions test\n- no record was produced due to low emissions\n\nTest procedure - vehicles manufactured before 1980\nVehicles manufactured before 1980 only need to be visually inspected for emitted smoke at both idle and during free acceleration.\nHow to test:\n\n- Make sure the engine is at its normal operating temperature - use the temperature gauge, cooling fan cut in or hot coolant hoses to check this.\n- Make sure any oil temperature probe has been removed.\n- Increase the engine speed to around 2,500rpm or half the maximum engine speed - use whichever speed is lower.\n- Keep the engine at this speed for 30 seconds - this should fully purge the inlet and exhaust system.\n- Allow the engine to return to idle.\n- Assess the smoke emitted from the tailpipe.\n- Quickly increase the engine speed to around 2,500rpm or half the maximum engine speed - use whichever speed is lower and assess the smoke emitted from the tailpipe.\n\nTest procedure - vehicles manufactured in or after 1980\nVehicles manufactured in or after 1980 must be tested for exhaust smoke using an approved diesel smoke meter. Make sure you follow the smoke meter manufacturer's instructions.\nWhen testing automatic transmission, you might want to check the vehicle manufacturer's instructions so that you do not overheat the transmission system. Avoid unnecessary engine acceleration or prolonged high revving of the engine.\nBefore the test, check the maximum smoke level limit for the vehicle and enter the required details into the diesel smoke meter.\nThe maximum smoke level limit will be the level displayed on the manufacturer's plate; or where there is no manufacturer's plate information:\nFor vehicles first used before 1 July 2008, the maximum level is:\n\n- 2.5m-1 for a non-turbocharged engine\n- 3.0m-1 for a turbocharged engine\n\nFor vehicles first used between 1 July 2008 and 31 December 2013 the maximum level is 1.5m-1 for all engines.\nFor vehicles first used on or after 1 January 2014 the maximum level is 0.7m-1 for all engines.\nManufacturer's plate means either the VIN plate or a separate plate or sticker, which is likely to be within the engine compartment. The plate or sticker may be marked 24 R followed by a number to indicate the smoke limit (such as 0.24 in the example below). It's usually displayed in a box and often positioned in the bottom right corner of the VIN plate.\nAn example of a manufacturer's plate can be found in Section 2 of the Introduction.\nHow to test:\n\n- Make sure the engine checks are satisfactory.\n- Make sure the engine temperature is above 80 degrees centigrade or at its normal operating temperature whichever is lower.\n- Make sure you've removed any oil temperature probes.\n- Increase the engine speed to around 2,500rpm or half the maximum engine speed - use whichever speed is lower.\n- Keep the engine at this speed for 30 seconds - this should fully purge the inlet and exhaust system.\n- Increase the engine speed slowly to maximum engine revolutions (revs) to check that the governor is working properly\n- Once the engine speed has stabilized or it becomes clear that the governor is not working, release the pedal and allow the engine to return to idle.\n- Stop the engine and prompt the meter to do a zero check.\n- Insert the meter fully and securely in line with the gas flow.\n- Restart the engine.\n- Following the meter prompts, press down the accelerator pedal quickly and continuously so that the engine reaches full fuel position in less than one second.\n- Hold the engine at full fuel position until a release prompt is given and immediately release the accelerator pedal.\n- Allow the engine and any turbochargers to return to idle.\n- After the first acceleration read the smoke level displayed on the meter.\n- If the smoke level is above the limit for the vehicle, carry out 2 further accelerations.\n- If the mean smoke level is still above the limit for the vehicle, carry out further accelerations up to a maximum of 6 in total and read the smoke level display on the meter after each acceleration.\n\nThe vehicle has passed the opacity test if any of the following happens:\n\n- the first acceleration showed that the smoke level was at 60% or less than the limit for the vehicle\n- the mean smoke level from the first 3 readings was at or less than the limit for the vehicle\n- the mean smoke level from any consecutive 3 readings was at or less than the limit for the vehicle\n\nIf the smoke levels from the first acceleration were significantly higher than the limit, you can choose to not complete the test.\nOn vehicles fitted with a diesel particulate filter, also check that no visible smoke is emitted from the exhaust during the metered check.\nIf the vehicle passes the test, the VTS must keep a readily retrievable record for 3 months. The customer must be provided with a printout of the result if one is requested.\nIf the vehicle fails the emissions test, a copy of the result print out must be given to the customer. The VTS must keep a readily retrievable record of the result for 3 months.\nRetesting a vehicle that failed for smoke emissions\nIf you retest a vehicle that failed for smoke emissions exceeding the manufacturer's specified limit using the vehicle plate value, you must retest the vehicle to the same plate value.\nVehicles fitted with a different engine\nIf a vehicle first used before 1 September 2002 is fitted with an engine that's older than the vehicle, you must test it to the standards applicable for the engine. The vehicle presenter must have proof of the age of the engine.\nIf a vehicle first used on or after 1 September 2002 is fitted with a different engine, you must test it to the standards for the age of the vehicle.\nIf an engine has been modified in any way, it still must meet the exhaust opacity requirements according to the age of the vehicle.\nKit cars\nKit cars and amateur built vehicles first used on or after 1 August 1998 must have either Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) or Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA).\nYou must test kit cars or amateur built vehicles to the limits in the vehicle's registration document (V5c). If the V5c does not show any limits, you must test it to the limits of the engine fitted at the time of the SVA or IVA test.\n\"Not tested\" or \"Unable to be tested\" must only be used where it becomes apparent during the test that the particular item cannot be tested, and this could not have been identified prior to starting the test.
