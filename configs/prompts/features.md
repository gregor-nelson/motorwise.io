# Vehicle Analysis Component Enhancements

## 1. Data Sources and Integration
Currently, the component uses:
- DVLA ownership records (V5C data)
- Registration data and regional analysis
- Basic year calculations

We could enhance this with:

### Vehicle MOT History
Incorporate full MOT test history including:
- Test pass/fail pattern
- Advisory notices timeline
- Odometer reading progression to detect potential mileage discrepancies
- Specific component failures (e.g., recurring brake or suspension issues)

### Insurance Database Integration
- Previous insurance write-offs or category classifications (Cat S, Cat N, etc.)
- Insurance claims history
- Theft records

### Import Status Verification
- More detailed import history for non-UK vehicles
- Original market specifications
- Compliance with UK standards

### Mileage Verification Services
- Cross-reference reported mileage with MOT and service records
- Flag potential discrepancies
- Show average mileage calculations per year

### HPI Check Integration
- Finance checks (outstanding finance)
- Stolen vehicle checks
- Plate/VIN matching

## 2. Enhanced Risk Analysis
We can improve risk analysis by:

### Ownership Pattern Analysis
- Create a visual timeline of ownership changes
- Flag patterns associated with "car flipping" (multiple short-term ownerships)
- Analyze seasonal ownership patterns (e.g., winter sales of sports cars)

### Multi-factor Risk Scoring
Develop a more sophisticated algorithm that weighs multiple factors:
- Ownership duration
- Registration region and usage patterns
- Mileage vs. age ratio
- MOT history patterns
- Number of previous owners
- Registration gaps
- Make/model/trim specific issues

### Model-Specific Risk Assessment
- Incorporate known reliability issues for specific makes/models/years
- Common failure points at specific mileage markers
- Manufacturer recall compliance
- Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) checks

### Registration Analysis Enhancements
- Cross-reference with flood risk areas
- Local air quality (for potential catalytic converter issues)
- Road salt usage patterns in specific regions
- Cross-reference with accident blackspots

### Commercial Use Detection
- Algorithms to detect potential undisclosed taxi/fleet/rental use
- Analysis of ownership patterns typical of fleet vehicles
- Integration with private hire licensing data

## 3. UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Timeline
- Interactive ownership timeline showing changes, MOTs, and key events
- Visual representation of risk factors with severity indicators

### Condition Probability Maps
- Visual representation of the vehicle showing areas of potential concern based on age, region, and usage
- Heat maps for common problem areas based on make/model/age

### Confidence Indicators
- Clear visualization of confidence levels for different data points
- Explanation of data sources and reliability

### Report Export Options
- Allow users to export a comprehensive pre-purchase report
- PDF generation with all risk factors and insights

### Interactive Risk Explorer
- Allow users to drill down into specific risk categories
- Toggle between summary and detailed views
