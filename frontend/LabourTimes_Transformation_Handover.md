## 🚨 PHASE 0: MANDATORY ANALYSIS (Before Any Code)

### Step 1: Component Analysis (Required)

Before touching ANY code, you MUST:

1. **Read and understand the current LabourTimes.jsx completely**
   - What repair/labour time data does it display?
   - How is the repair information currently organized?
   - What's the calculator functionality? (RateCalc component)
   - What user interactions are available?
   - How does the current tabbed interface work?
   - What's the current information hierarchy?

2. **Identify Layout Problems**
   - Is repair time information cluttered or hard to scan?
   - Are related repair tasks grouped logically?
   - Is the calculator interface intuitive?
   - Are there too many columns/sections competing for attention?
   - Is the mobile experience poor?
   - Does the tabbed interface help or hinder navigation?

3. **Study the Data Structure**
   - What repair time data is being shown?
   - How are repair tasks categorized/organized from the API?
   - Which repair times are most important to users?
   - What's the relationship between repair tasks and labour costs?
   - How does the rate calculator integrate with repair data?

### Step 2: UX Strategy Planning (Required)

Create a written plan addressing:

1. **Information Architecture**
   - How should repair times be grouped? (Engine, Body, Electrical, etc.)
   - What's the priority hierarchy? (Most common repairs first?)
   - Should there be search/filter functionality?
   - How should the calculator relate to the repair time data?
   - What needs to be visible immediately vs. on-demand?

2. **Layout Strategy**
   - Card-based layout vs. table vs. mixed approach?
   - Should repair tasks be scannable (like a service menu)?
   - How should labour costs be presented?
   - Where should the rate calculator be positioned?
   - How many columns for different screen sizes?

3. **User Experience Flow**
   - What does a mechanic/user want to accomplish with labour times?
   - How do they find specific repair procedures?
   - How do they calculate costs for multiple repairs?
   - Should there be comparison capabilities?
   - How do labour times relate to other vehicle service data?

### Step 3: Design System Study (Required)

Before coding, thoroughly study:

1. **BulletinsComponent Success Patterns**
   - How was the design system implemented cleanly?
   - What component patterns were used?
   - How was responsive design handled?
   - Study the BulletinStyles.jsx architecture

2. **Home Page Patterns**
   - How are sections organized?
   - What card/panel patterns are used?
   - How is information hierarchy established?
   - What spacing patterns create visual calm?

## 🚨 Critical Questions to Answer Before Coding

### Information Architecture
1. What are the most common repair tasks users need immediately?
2. How should 50+ repair tasks be organized without overwhelming?
3. Which repairs need visual emphasis (time-critical, expensive)?
4. Should there be a "quick estimate" for common service packages?

### Layout Strategy
1. Is the current tabbed interface helping or hindering?
2. How can we make finding specific repairs fast?
3. What's the mobile strategy for complex repair time data?
4. Should repair costs be prominent or on-demand?

### Calculator Integration
1. How does the rate calculator currently work?
2. Should calculation be real-time or on-demand?
3. How can multiple repair selection be intuitive?
4. Should there be preset service packages?

### User Experience
1. Who uses labour time data? (Mechanics, customers, service advisors)
2. How do they use this information in their workflow?
3. What other vehicle data should be integrated/linked?
4. How can we reduce cognitive load while showing detailed data?

## 🛠 Phase 2: Implementation Strategy (After Planning)

**Only After Completing Phase 1 Analysis:**

1. **Create Clean Styled Components**
   - Follow BulletinStyles.jsx pattern exactly
   - Design clean, reusable repair display components
   - Plan responsive grid/flex layouts
   - Create loading and empty states

2. **Implement Design System**
   - Apply Home page styling patterns
   - Use consistent spacing and typography
   - Implement smooth interactions
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

3. **Optimize User Experience**
   - Integrate calculator seamlessly
   - Add search/filter capabilities if needed
   - Implement progressive disclosure
   - Ensure mobile-first responsive design

## ⚠️ Critical Issues Found in Current Component

### Styling System Contamination
The current LabourTimes.jsx has the same issues as the BulletinsComponent had:
- **Mixed styling systems**: Uses old GovUK theme components AND Material-UI styled components
- **External dependencies**: Imports from contaminated `./styles/style.js`
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Mix of old and newer approaches

### Technical Debt
- Lines 2-13: Old theme system imports (`COLORS`, `GovUKContainer`, etc.)
- Lines 33-51: References to contaminated shared styles
- Lines 68-100: Material-UI styled components with old theme references
- Heavy reliance on deprecated styling patterns

### Recommended Approach
1. **Create dedicated LabourTimesStyles.jsx** (like BulletinStyles.jsx)
2. **Do NOT edit the existing styles/style.js file**
3. **Follow the exact pattern from BulletinsComponent transformation**

## 🎯 Getting Started Instructions

**DO NOT START WITH CODE!**

1. **First**: Read LabourTimes.jsx completely (understand current functionality)
2. **Second**: Study RateCalc.jsx to understand calculator integration
3. **Third**: Analyze the current UX and identify problems
4. **Fourth**: Study BulletinsComponent.jsx and BulletinStyles.jsx patterns
5. **Fifth**: Study the Home page design patterns thoroughly
6. **Sixth**: Create a written plan for the new layout/UX approach
7. **Seventh**: Get feedback on the plan before implementing
8. **Only Then**: Begin creating the new LabourTimesStyles.jsx file

### Questions to Research First:
- How do automotive service professionals use labour time data?
- What are the best practices for presenting repair cost information?
- How do service estimation tools typically work?
- What's the optimal mobile experience for complex service data?
- How should calculator functionality integrate with data presentation?

---

## 📚 Recommended Research Before Starting

1. **Study these patterns for labour time UX**:
   - Automotive service estimation websites
   - Repair shop management software interfaces
   - Mobile service booking apps
   - Technical repair documentation sites

2. **Analyze the current component thoroughly**:
   - Map out all the repair data being displayed
   - Understand the calculator functionality and integration
   - Identify user pain points and workflow issues
   - Note performance or loading issues

3. **Study the successful transformation**:
   - BulletinsComponent.jsx - the "after" state
   - BulletinStyles.jsx - clean design system implementation
   - Home page patterns and spacing
   - Design system custom properties usage

## 🚀 Ready to Begin Analysis

**Remember: ANALYSIS and PLANNING first, code second!**

The goal is to create a labour times experience that feels as clean and approachable as the Home page while presenting complex automotive repair data and cost calculations in a digestible, professionally useful way.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- **Calculator Integration**: How does cost estimation work with repair data?
- **Information Findability**: How do users quickly find specific repairs?  
- **Mobile Experience**: How do complex repair lists work on small screens?
- **Professional Workflow**: How does this fit into real service planning?

Start with understanding, then plan, then build. 🔧➡️📋➡️🎨➡️💻

## 🎨 Component Architecture Guidance

When you do reach implementation (after planning), follow this exact pattern:

1. **Create `LabourTimesStyles.jsx`** (copy BulletinStyles.jsx structure)
2. **Update imports in LabourTimes.jsx** (like BulletinsComponent.jsx)  
3. **Keep calculator integration** but with clean styling
4. **Maintain all functionality** while improving UX
5. **Test responsive behavior** across all devices

The BulletinsComponent transformation is your blueprint - follow its patterns exactly! 🎯
