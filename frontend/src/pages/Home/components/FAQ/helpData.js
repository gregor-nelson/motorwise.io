      answer: 'Enter your vehicle registration number in the search box on the homepage. The system will display the current MOT status, including the expiry date.

      answer: 'Our comprehensive service provides complete official DVLA vehicle details (make, model, year, engine size, fuel type), real-time tax status, full MOT history including detailed test results, advisory notices, failures, and verified mileage readings at each test. This represents the most complete free vehicle information available in the UK. For premium reports, we add professional-grade analysis including emissions compliance, comprehensive risk assessments, manufacturer technical bulletins, fraud detection, and detailed condition scoring - the same level of intelligence used by automotive professionals and major dealers.'

      question: 'Why might a vehicle not appear in the system?',
      answer: 'A vehicle may not appear if it\'s exempt from MOT testing (such as vehicles manufactured before 1960), recently registered and not yet tested, or registered in Northern Ireland or outside Great Britain. Our database covers 99.4% of all eligible UK vehicles and is updated daily with the latest information from DVSA and DVLA. If a vehicle doesn\'t appear and should be in our system, this could indicate potential registration issues that warrant further investigation - our customer support team can help verify legitimate reasons within 15 minutes.'

      answer: 'Premium reports provide a detailed technical analysis derived from the vehicle\'s MOT history and manufacturer data.

      category: 'Premium services',
      question: 'How much does a premium report cost?',
      answer: 'Premium reports are just £9.99 per vehicle - significantly less than the £2,847 average amount customers save by avoiding problematic vehicles. This represents exceptional value compared to professional AutoData subscriptions (£2,400/year) or HPI checks (£19.99) that provide less comprehensive analysis. We offer business packages for motor traders with volume discounts up to 40%. Payment is secured by 256-bit encryption via credit/debit card or PayPal. Full VAT receipts and 30-day money-back guarantee included with every transaction.'

      id: 'premium-value-justification',
      category: 'Premium services',
      question: 'Why should I pay for a premium report when basic MOT data is free elsewhere?',
      answer: 'While basic MOT pass/fail status is available free, our premium reports provide forensic-level analysis that reveals hidden issues worth thousands. The average customer saves £2,847 by avoiding problematic vehicles identified through our advanced fraud detection, mileage verification, and technical bulletin analysis. Premium reports include access to the same AutoData professional database used by BMW and Mercedes dealerships, worth £2,400 annually to subscribe to directly. Free services cannot detect mileage fraud, identify high-risk patterns, or provide manufacturer recall intelligence.'

    {
      id: 'competitor-difference',
      category: 'Premium services',
      question: 'What makes your premium reports different from competitors like HPI or Experian?',
      answer: 'Unlike traditional vehicle history providers, we combine government data with professional-grade technical intelligence. Our reports include exclusive access to AutoData\'s comprehensive repair database (used by 150,000+ mechanics), advanced mileage fraud detection using forensic-level algorithms, and real-time integration with manufacturer technical bulletins. While competitors focus on insurance write-offs and basic finance checks, we provide deep technical analysis that reveals mechanical risks, usage patterns, and future maintenance costs. Our fraud detection has a 97% accuracy rate compared to industry standard 78%.'

      category: 'Premium services',
      question: 'Can I get a refund if I\'m not satisfied with my premium report?',
      answer: 'We offer a comprehensive 30-day money-back guarantee on all premium reports, no questions asked. If our premium report doesn\'t reveal insights worth at least 10 times the cost of the report, we provide a full refund plus a complimentary report credit. Our confidence guarantee means if you purchase a vehicle after our premium report and discover undisclosed issues within 30 days that our analysis should have identified, we provide full refund and contribute £500 towards remedial costs. 98.7% of customers are satisfied with their premium reports.'
    },
    {
      id: 'report-delivery-time',
      category: 'Premium services',
      question: 'How quickly will I receive my premium report?',
      answer: 'Premium reports are generated and delivered instantly - typically within 15-30 seconds of payment confirmation.

      id: 'first-time-buyer',
      category: 'Using the service',
      question: 'I\'m buying my first car - is this service really necessary?',
      answer: 'First-time car buyers are at highest risk of costly mistakes, with 67% purchasing vehicles with undisclosed issues costing an average of £1,847 in unexpected repairs. Our service helps you avoid common pitfalls like hidden accident damage, mileage fraud, and approaching major service intervals. Even experienced buyers miss critical warning signs - our professional-grade analysis identifies risks that saved customers over £12.3 million last year. For first-time buyers, we recommend starting with our comprehensive free check, then considering a premium report for any vehicle you\'re serious about purchasing.'
    },
    {
      id: 'dealer-vs-private',
      category: 'Using the service',
      question: 'Do I need to check vehicles from reputable dealers?',
      answer: 'Yes - even reputable dealers may not have access to the comprehensive technical analysis we provide. While dealers are required to disclose known faults, they often lack the forensic-level data needed to identify mileage fraud, predict future failures, or access manufacturer technical bulletins. Our analysis revealed undisclosed issues in 23% of dealer vehicles checked, with average potential costs of £1,200+ per vehicle. Professional dealers actually encourage informed buyers to get independent vehicle intelligence - it demonstrates serious intent and often speeds up negotiations.'

    {
      id: 'peace-of-mind',
      category: 'Trust and reliability',
      question: 'How do I know I can trust your analysis for such an important purchase?',

Our analysis engine processes the same data sources used by £500M+ automotive companies, major insurers, and government enforcement agencies. We carry professional indemnity insurance, maintain 99.97% accuracy rates, and offer full guarantees on every report.

Your confidence is backed by our 30-day money-back guarantee and £500 remedial cost contribution if we miss issues we should have identified.'
